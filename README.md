# Linear Regression - Real Data
Machine Learning training project utilising [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to build an ML model and make predictions.

#### Project status - Complete

## Introduction

My focus here was not so much to build a high quality model or to make accurate predictions, but rather to become familiar with the code and simply to be able to build a functioning model.

This was based on examples used in the excellent [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro) offered by Google.



### Methods used
* EDA
* Machine Learning
* Data visualisation

### Technologies used
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

### Data sources
[California Housing Dataset](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/california-housing-data-description) based on the 1990 US Census. This is a familiar dataset for Machine Learning training, so apologies for the lack of originality! 

Sourced from [Google](https://download.mlcc.google.com/mledu-datasets/california_housing_train.csv).


### Getting started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is kept in the CSV file in the root folder of this repo.
3. All code is contained within the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thecraigd/Linear_Regression_with_TensorFlow/blob/master/LinearRegression.ipynb) for this project, stored in the root folder as LinearRegression.ipynb


## Featured Notebooks
